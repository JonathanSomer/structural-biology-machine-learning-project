======================================
 CDR utility: cdr.Linux or cdr3.Linux 
======================================

The utilities find the residues which are most likely to be the CDRs of the
antibody. The cdr.Linux find all six loops, while cdr3.Linux ouputs only H3 and
L3 loops.  
The CDR detection is performed by aligning the sequence generated from the pdb
file with the consensus sequences (read from the directory given as a second
parameter).

INPUT:
-----
The input to the program is PDB file, including antibody light and heavy 
chains and the directory of the files containing sequences.
The files are inside the directory including the utility.

OUTPUT:
------
The output is residue number and chain in each line. The first consecutive
residues are of CDR-1 of the light chain, the last consecutive residues are
those of CDR-3 of the heavy chain. This output format can be used for PatchDock
active site parameter (see PatchDock README).
